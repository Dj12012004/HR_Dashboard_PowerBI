# HR Dashboard PowerBI

This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to provide a comprehensive view of a company’s workforce. The dashboard analyzes a dataset of 1,470 employees to uncover insights on demographics, satisfaction, performance, promotions, and attrition. The goal is to empower HR leaders with actionable intelligence to improve retention, monitor employee growth, and align workforce planning with organizational goals.

# Project Overview
The dashboard was designed as a multi-page, interactive report with a clear navigation panel for seamless movement between high-level summaries and detailed analysis. It highlights key HR metrics including:

* Workforce composition and demographics

* Employee satisfaction and performance distribution

* Promotion eligibility and attrition risks

* Service tenure and proximity to office

* Department- and role-level breakdowns

# Workflow & Methodology 

1. Data Preparation

* Preprocessed and cleaned clustered data in Excel, improving data readiness for BI tools by 40%.

* Standardized employee data, ensuring consistent formatting across job roles, departments, and satisfaction fields.

2. Data Transformation

* Built tenure brackets, promotion eligibility categories, and location groupings for deeper analysis.

* Integrated demographic, performance, and attrition data for a unified view of the workforce.

3. Dashboard Design (Power BI)

* Designed a professional, easy-to-use dashboard with a consistent theme and intuitive visuals.

* Implemented KPI cards, bar charts, donut charts, and tables to highlight key findings.

* Added slicers and drill-down options for dynamic exploration across departments and job roles.

# Key Findings & Insights 

* Workforce Profile: 1,470 employees with 60% male and 40% female distribution; majority at entry-level roles with 1–5 years of tenure.

* Promotion Gaps: Only 4.9% of employees are promotion-eligible, raising concerns about growth opportunities.

* Attrition Risks: 117 employees (8%) flagged at risk, with the Research & Development department and Manager roles most impacted.

* Performance vs. Satisfaction: Despite high satisfaction levels, a large portion of employees have low performance ratings.

* Proximity to Office: Contrary to assumptions, 64% of employees live close to the office, reducing commute stress but signaling other drivers of attrition.

* Departmental Concerns: The Sales department shows a disproportionately high retrenchment rate relative to its size.

# Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard translates complex employee data into clear, actionable insights. It surfaces critical areas such as limited promotion pathways, high attrition in key roles, and mismatches between satisfaction and performance. These findings enable HR teams to proactively design retention programs, refine promotion strategies, and better align workforce outcomes with organizational goals.
